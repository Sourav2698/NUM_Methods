Given Polynomial Equation : Pn(x) = 9*x^4 + 30*x^3 + 34*x^2 + 30*x + 25 = 0

1) BIRJE-VIETA METHOD :
==========================

OUTPUT:
--------
Root no. - 1 after 20 iterations is -1.66667
Root no. - 2 after 1 iterations is -1.66667
No more roots found: Maximum iterations reached ! 

REMARKS: 
---------
The Birje-Vieta method is used to find all real roots of a polynomial equation, but this method is not applicable to 
find the complex roots. Using the algorithm, only two equal roots (-1.66667) of the polynomial equation are found. 
Although this is a 4th order polynomial, we obtain only 2 roots. So, it can be inferred that the other two roots are 
complex and hence cannot be obtained by this method.





2) GRAEFFE'S METHOD :
=======================

OUTPUT:
--------
Root no. 1 is  : -1.66723
Root no. 2 is  : -1.6661
Root no. 3 is complex with modulus : 1.00034
Root no. 4 is complex with modulus : 0.999662

REMARKS:
---------
The Graeffe's method gives only the modulus of the roots. To find the sign of the roots we check the value of the polynomial function
at the mod values of the roots. If the functional value is greater than a desired tolerance, it will be identified as a negative
root. The functional value is also checked for the negative value. Two negative real roots (-1.66723 and -1.6661) are obtained. Descartes 
Rule of Signs supports two or less (even) number of negative roots of the given polynomial. Also, the values of the polynomial for
the other two roots (3 & 4) obtained is found to be much larger than the tolerance value (both with negative and positive sign). Thus, 
the rest two roots obtained are identified as the modulus of two complex roots of the polynomial.
